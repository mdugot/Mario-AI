A realtime Mario AI based on a genetic algorithm solve some procedurally generated level based on the orignal Mario levels through machine learning. 

The Mario emulation engine is based on the [Mario-AI-Framework](https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework).

The genetic algorithm AI is inspired by the paper [Learning Levels of Mario AI Using Genetic Algorithms](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/44310211.pdf). </br>
The level generation thourgh machine learning is inspired by the paper [Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00539).
